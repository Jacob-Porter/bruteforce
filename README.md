# bruteforce

Assignment for my Intro to Security class where we had to try and bruteforce the key used for the encryption. The method for generating the key used for the encryption is commented at the top of "encryption.py".

Took about 3.5-4.5 hours for the program to find the key (look at plaintext_4 for the result).
